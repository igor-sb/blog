Multiple hypothesis testing occurs frequently in fields where we can generate a lot of features, and we need to test whether each of the features represents a possible novel discovery. For example, in genomics applied to disease studies we want to test whether any of the thousands of genes, has activity significantly different than in non-diseased individuals.\n",
